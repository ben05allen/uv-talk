However having seen the code and what uv is doing, ***even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing***. I believe that even in case Astral shuts down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the community would be better off than before uv existed.\"  (my emphasis)\n",

    "Package resolution is generally regarded as *NP-Complete* (akin to the Boolean satisfiability problem), in the worst cast all possibilities need to be tried.  But good heuristics are available and can solve large problem instances.  `uv` uses `pubgrub-rs`, a Rust implementation of [`PubGrub`](https://pubgrub-rs-guide.pages.dev/internals/intro), an *incremental version solver* algorithm.\n",

    "1. Speed matters - a `venv` costs almost nothing to set up, it's takes longer for us to type `cd`.  A tool like `uv` makes new workflows practical.\n",
    "2. On the shoulders of giants - tools such as `uv` are an evolution, they come about from the mountains of work that people have put into tools like `pip` or `poetry` previously.\n",
    "3. A rising tide lifts all boats, c.f. Pandas & Polars, Node & Deno, black & ruff, npm & bun -- none of these are going away anytime soon, in fact features tend to flow between them."
