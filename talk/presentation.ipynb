However having seen the code and what uv is doing, ***even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing***\\*. I believe that even in case Astral shuts down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the community would be better off than before uv existed.\"  \n",

    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">1. Rust Package Resolution</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "Package resolution is generally regarded as *NP-Complete* (akin to the Boolean satisfiability problem), in the worst cast all possibilities need to be tried.  But good heuristics are available and can solve large problem instances.  `uv` uses `pubgrub-rs`, a Rust implementation of [`PubGrub`](https://pubgrub-rs-guide.pages.dev/internals/intro), an *incremental version solver* algorithm.\n",

    "<h3 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">What makes `uv` so fast? (cont.)</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">2. Concurrent Package Downloads</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once package versions are resolved required downloads happen concurrently, while other package managers may download sequentially by default (ie `pip`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">3. Caching</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "`uv` uses caching to avoid downloading where possible, the cache is designed so that it can be used concurrently, as well as with continuous integration environments.  Caching isn't unique to `uv`, you can set up caching with `pip`, however the stated policy of `uv` is to cache *aggressively*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Caching also helps reduce the number of downloads your project makes from PyPI.  According to [Michael Kennedy](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/lets-go-easy-on-pypi-ok/) more than 284 billion downloads were made in 2023 alone."
