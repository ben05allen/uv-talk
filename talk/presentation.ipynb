Here is my take on this: for the community having someone pour money into it can create some challenges. For the PSF and the core Python project this is something that should be considered. However having seen the code and what uv is doing, ***even in the worst possible future this is a very forkable and maintainable thing***. I believe that even in case Astral shuts down or were to do something incredibly dodgy licensing wise, the community would be better off than before uv existed.\"  (my emphasis)\n",

    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">1. Rust Package Resolution</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "Package resolution is generally regarded as *NP-Complete* (akin to the Boolean satisfiability problem), in the worst cast all possibilities need to be tried.  But good heuristics are available and can solve large problem instances.  `uv` uses `pubgrub-rs`, a Rust implementation of [`PubGrub`](https://pubgrub-rs-guide.pages.dev/internals/intro), an *incremental version solver* algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an aside, `uv` creates lockfiles which is independent of platform, locking dependencies regardless of operating system or python version.  `uv` will try to use the most recent version of each package, but there are options to resolve for the oldest packages too.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">2. Concurrent Package Downloads</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once package versions are resolved required downloads happen concurrently, while other package managers may download sequentially by default (ie `pip`).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5 style=\"color:DodgerBlue\">3. Caching</h5>\n",
    "\n",
    "`uv` uses caching to avoid downloading where possible, the cache is designed so that it can be used concurrently, as well as with continuous integration environments.  Caching isn't unique to `uv`, you can set up caching with `pip`, however the stated policy of `uv` is to cache *aggressively*.  Caching also helps reduce the number of downloads your project makes from PyPI (more than 284 billion downloads in 2023 according to [Michael Kennedy](https://mkennedy.codes/posts/lets-go-easy-on-pypi-ok/).)\n"

    "1. Speed matters - a `venv` costs almost nothing to set up, it's takes longer for us to type `cd`.  A tool like `uv` makes new workflows possible and practical.\n",
